# Advanced Topics in Programming Languages 2021/22

Advanced Topics in Programming Languages is a fourth year optional unit at the University of Bristol. We will give you a grounding in the field of Programming Languages, along with an insight into what it is like to be Programming Languages researcher.

The unit will be based on Robert Harper's book [_Practical Foundations for
Programming Languages_](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/) (Cambridge University
Press, 2nd edition, 2016). An electronic copy of the book may be obtained
through the University of Bristol library.
