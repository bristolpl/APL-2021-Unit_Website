# Problem Classes

For this unit we will hold **problem classes**. These will be your
opportunity to ask any questions about the course content.

For each problem class there will be an associated **problem sheet**. To do
well in this unit you are expected to attempt the questions on the problem
sheet - even if you don't manage to solve them. These will form the basis of
many discussions in the problem classes.

**WHERE:** Queen's Building 1.68 / [Teams "Virtual Problem Class"
channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a41cf0321b0a04cd7b4d2080653b2b93e%40thread.tacv2/Virtual%2520Problem%2520Class?groupId=68f87e2e-dfc5-48c2-b267-49f1769e1c29&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b)

You can decide how you attend, this just means that if you cannot come in for
any reason, you don't have to worry. (In the case that one of our TAs is
unavailable, only the virtual version will take place.)

**WHEN:** Fridays 11-12pm

**WHO:** Our TAs, Eddie and Sam, will be running the problem classes and
marking your work. Sam will run the in-person sessions, and Eddie will do the virtual ones.

**HOW:**

You will have the opportunity to get your answers marked by a TA.
To do this, email your answers as a PDF with the filename of your name and email subject if "APL sheet n" (where n is the sheet numnber) to **Sam** by **5pm on Monday**. Eddie and Sam will then work together to mark them by the Friday
problem class where it will be returned to you via the [Files facility on
Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/files/General?groupId=68f87e2e-dfc5-48c2-b267-49f1769e1c29&threadId=19%3AYLl8cZ1LVsO2bu8XXjE8QTc7WUPHgPZGzPmXUGdID-k1%40thread.tacv2&ctx=channel&context=Worksheet%2520Return&rootfolder=%252Fteams%252FUnitTeams-COMSM0066-2021-22-TB-1-A%252FShared%2520Documents%252FGeneral%252FWorksheet%2520Return).

NOTE:- since the class involves running through a sheet, our first proper class will be in week two (8th of October).
