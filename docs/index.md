# Advanced Topics in Programming Languages 2022/23

Advanced Topics in Programming Languages is a fourth year optional unit at the University of Bristol. The unit provides a grounding in the field of Programming Languages, along with an insight into what it is like to be Programming Languages researcher.

This year the unit will be based on Robert Harper's book [_Practical Foundations for
Programming Languages_](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/) (Cambridge University
Press, 2nd edition, 2016). An electronic copy of the book may be obtained
through the University of Bristol library.
