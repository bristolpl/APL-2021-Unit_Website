# Problem Classes

For this unit we will hold **problem classes**. 

For each problem class there will be an associated **problem sheet**. To pass this unit you are expected to attempt _all_ the questions on the problem sheet. These are generally difficult questions; the point is not to solve them, but to think about them. We will use these questions to explore various additional themes and/or hold discussions.

In the classes you will also have the opportunity to ask further questions.


**WHERE:** Queen's building 1.68

**WHEN:** Tuesdays 2pm-3pm (week 2 onwards)

**WHO:** Charlie and Sam will be running the problem classes and marking your work.

**HOW:** You will have the opportunity to get the answers to questions marked by an asterisk (*) marked by a TA. Please submit your answers on Blackboard by **5pm on the Monday preceding the problem class.**
